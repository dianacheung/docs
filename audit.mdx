## Evaluate API Reference Core Elements

### Resource description

1. Is the description action-oriented? \
Yes.
> Create a Message.
2. Is it a brief 1-3 sentence summary? \
Yes.
> Create a Message.
>
> Send a structured list of input messages with text and/or image content, and the model will generate the next message in the conversation.
>
> The Messages API can be used for for either single queries or stateless multi-turn conversations.

Note: 
OpenAI's Chat API description is clearer:
> Given a list of messages comprising a conversation, the model will return a response … Creates a model response for the given chat conversation.

### Endpoints and methods

1. How are the endpoints grouped? (Are they listed all on the same page, or on different pages? Are they grouped by method, or by resource?) \
There is only a single endpoint `POST /messages` (as of 3/27/2024).

2. How are the methods specified for each endpoint? \
The method is listed in front of the specific endpoint.

### Parameters

1. How many types of parameters are there (header, path, query string) or request body for the endpoints?

There are 3 header parameters: `x-api-key`, `anthropic-version`, `content-type`.

The `x-api-key` and `content-type` header parameters are explained in section <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/getting-started-with-the-api" target="_blank">https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/getting-started-with-the-api</a>.

The `anthropic-version` parameter (2023-06-01, 2023-01-01) is explained in section <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/versions" target="_blank">https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/versions</a>.

The `anthropic-version` parameter can cause confusion, as the endpoint states v1 https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages. Why is this not v2?

There are no path nor query string parameters.

There is a long list of request body parameters: name, data type, required/blank.

Examples are provided for the messages request body parameters and also in section <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/messages-examples" target="_blank">https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/messages-examples</a>.

`max_tokens`: It should clarify that this is only for the generated model response, and not shared with the context window (this differs from OpenAI's API: The total length of input tokens and generated tokens is limited by the model's context length).

`stream`: Clarify whether this is only for SDK API calls?

`top_p`: Needs to specify range and default value.

`top_k`: Needs to clarify if it can be used with top_p or temperature? Needs to specify range and default value.

2. Are the data types (string, boolean, etc.) defined for each parameter? Are required/optional values noted?

Yes, the data type and required/optional value are defined for each request body parameter.

### Request example

1. In what format or language is the request shown (e.g. curl, specific languages, other)?

The example request is show in cURL, Python, and JavaScript.

2. How many parameters does the sample request include?

The example request includes 3 header parameters and 3 body parameters (all required).

</Frame>

### Response example

1. Is there both a sample response and a response schema? (And is each element in the response actually described?)

Yes, there is a sample response and schema.

2. How does the doc site handle nested hierarchies in the response definitions?

Children are nested directly inside the parent section.

<Frame caption="A screenshot of Anthropic's Claude API POST /messages endpoint response content property (accessed 3/27/2024). Source: https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/messages_post">

    alt="A screenshot of Anthropic's Claude API POST /messages endpoint response content property (accessed 3/27/2024)."/>
</Frame>

However, there appears to be inconsistent formatting (see content vs. usage).

<Frame caption="A screenshot of Anthropic's Claude API POST /messages endpoint response usage property (accessed 3/27/2024). Source: https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/messages_post">

    alt="A screenshot of Anthropic's Claude API POST /messages endpoint response usage property (accessed 3/27/2024)."/>
</Frame>

Compared with OpenAI’s API, the nesting is more consistent with the Show and Hide properties toggle.

## Evaluate Developer Experience Criteria

Based on the <a href="https://everydeveloper.com/developer-experience/dx-guide/" target="_blank">13 DX Criteria by Adam DuVander at EveryDeveloper</a>.

### 1. Libraries in popular languages (very high importance)
Yes, SDKs in Python and JavaScript/TypeScript are available at <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/client-sdks" target="_blank">https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/client-sdks</a>.

### 2. In-depth getting started guides (very high importance)
There is a getting started guide at <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/getting-started-with-the-api" target="_blank">https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/getting-started-with-the-api</a>, but not in-depth.

### 3. Self-serve option: no demo or call us required (very high importance)
Yes, self sign up for API console access is available.

### 4. A clear pricing page (very high importance)
Yes, pricing information is available at <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/api" target="_blank">https://www.anthropic.com/api</a>. Providing some benchmarking of number of tokens equating to outcomes would be helpful. Clarify the token charges on both input and output. The plan tiers can be better presented.

### 5. A free tier or trial (high importance)
Currently, there is an offer for claiming free credits for API usage, but it is only called out inside the API console. Perhaps it can be displayed on pricing page.

### 6. An obvious place for questions (high importance)
Email support is available at support@anthropic.com.

Turns out there is a Discord community server at <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/discord" target="_blank">https://www.anthropic.com/discord</a> but it is hidden at the bottom of the page at <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/intro-to-claude" target="_blank">https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/intro-to-claude</a>.

### 7. API status information (high importance)
API status information isn't displayed currently.

### 8. Accurate API reference: source of truth (high importance)
Unable to ascertain if Anthropic's API reference is auto-generated from an OpenAPI Specification file.

### 9. Sample applications for download: after achieve hello world (high importance)
There are no sample applications featured, but examples of messages and SDKs are available.

### 10. Recent developer blog post (medium importance)
There are news posts at <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news" target="_blank">https://www.anthropic.com/news</a> but not developer posts currently.

### 11. Interactive documentation (medium importance)
There is copy and paste functionality along with sample request and response, but not interactive cURL calls.

### 12. Prominently featured documentation: navigation for API documentation and developers (medium importance)
Anthropic’s top navigation menu does feature an option for API, which leads to the Claude API page.

<Frame caption="A screenshot of Anthropic's Claude API landing page (accessed 3/27/2024). Source: https://www.anthropic.com/api">
  <img noZoom src="/images/2024-03-27_anthropic-api-landing-page.png" 
    alt="A screenshot of Anthropic's Claude API landing page (accessed 3/27/2024)."/>
</Frame>

However, the link to the API documentation is obscurely hidden in the Build plan information.

<Frame caption="A screenshot of Anthropic's Claude API plan tiers (accessed 3/27/2024). Source: https://www.anthropic.com/api">
  <img noZoom src="/images/2024-03-27_anthropic-api-tiers.png" 
    alt="A screenshot of Anthropic's Claude API plan tiers (accessed 3/27/2024)."/>
</Frame>

The API navigation menu should have submenus for Pricing/Models and API Documentation.

### 13. Example cURL calls: copy and paste examples with a working API key (medium importance)
Yes, example cURL call is available at <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/messages_post" target="_blank">https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/messages_post</a>. However, users need to provide their own API keys as no test API keys are available.
